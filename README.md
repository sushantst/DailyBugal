News App

This is a news app built with ASP.NET 8 MVC for demonstration purposes. It has Identity authentication for user authentication and shows news from different categories such as Climate, Business, Astrology, Politics, etc. It has features that include role-based authentication for different categories like Reporter and Viewer, allowing them different access levels. For example, a reporter has access to post content using WebAPI to the database; it can be premium content or free-tier content. Premium content requires a subscription based on different subscription models.

It has an integrated Razorpay for now, which supports UPI and card transactions. This also has a comments section to rate a certain section of news, which has an integrated SignalR, so that people can post real-time comments visible to all users for fast and reliable communication.
